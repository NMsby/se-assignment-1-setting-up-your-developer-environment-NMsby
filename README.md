------------------------- CONFIGURING GIT ON WINDOWS -----------------------------

# Configure Identity
- Your identity in Git is your username and email address which Git uses every time you create a commit. To set up your identity, open Git Bash and use the syntax below:

      $ git config --global user.name "[username]"

- Replace [username] with the actual username you will use. If you have a GitHub account, you can use that username and email. 

      $ git config --global user.email [email]

- Replace [email] with the email you want to use.


------------------ CREATING YOUR FIRST GIT REPOSITORY ---------------------------

# Check Git Version
- To check which Git version is installed on your system, open the PowerShell and run the following command:

      $ git --version

      ![Git Version](image-36.png)

- The output shows which Git versionis installed on the system.

# Create and Initialize Project Directory
   1. Open Git Bash or a Windows PowerShell interface and use the syntax below to create a new test directory (folder):

         $ mkdir [directory_name]
   
   2. Change your location to the newly created directory with the cd command:

         $ cd [directory_name]
   
   3. Initialize the directory as Git repository by running:

         $ git init

# Clone GitHub Repository
   1. In a web browser, navigate to your repository on GitHub.

   2. Click the Code button and select the HTTPS or SSH option, depending on how you want to secure your connection. For this tutorial, we will use HTTPS. Copy the URL for cloning the repository.

   ![GitHub Repository](image-37.png)

   3. Open Git Bash or Windows PowerShell and use the syntax below to clone the repository:

         $ git clone [repository_url]

# Push Local Files to Remote Repository
   1. Open Git Bash and create a new file with the touch command:

         $ touch text.txt

   2. Add your new file to the tracking index:

         $ git add text.txt

      If you have created multiple files, you can track all files by running:

         $ git add .
   
   3. Run the following command to make sure the text.txt file has been added:

         $ git status

   4. Next, commit the changes using the syntax below:

         $ git commit -m "[commit_message]"
   
      The -m option allows you to specify a commit message within the commit command. If you omit the -m option, Git opens the default text editor in which you can write the commit message.

   5. Finally, push the changes to the remote GitHub repository:

         $ git push [remote_repository]
   
      Replace [remote_repository] with the name of your remote repo. For example:

      ![Git Push Command](image-39.png)

TASK 4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
  Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.

-------------------------- STEPS TO INSTALL PYTHON -----------------------------

# STEP 1: Select Python Version
We recommend Python 3, as Python 2 reached its end of life in 2020. Download Python 2 only if you work with legacy scripts and older projects. Also, choose a stable release over the newest since the newest release may have bugs and issues.

# STEP 2: Download Python Executable Installer 
Start by downloading the Python executable installer for Windows:
1. Open a web browser and navigate to the Downloads for Windows section of the official Python website. >>https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/<<

2. Locate the desired Python version. 

![Python.org Download Page](image-40.png)

3. Click the link to download the file. Choose either the Windows 32-bit or 64-bit installer.

The download is approximately 25MB.

# STEP 3: Run Executable Installer

The steps below guide you through the installation process:

1. Run the downloaded Python Installer.

2. The installation window shows two checkboxes:

    Admin privileges. The parameter controls whether to install Python for the current or all system users. This option allows you to change the installation folder for Python.
    Add Python to PATH. The second option places the executable in the PATH variable after installation. You can also add Python to the PATH environment variable manually later.

![Python Setup Wizard](image-41.png)

For the most straightforward installation, we recommend ticking both checkboxes.

3. Select the Install Now option for the recommended installation (in that case, skip the next two steps).

To adjust the default installation options, choose Customize installation instead and proceed to the following step.

![Python Setup - Installation Path](image-42.png)

The default installation installs Python to C:\Users\[user]\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python[version] for the current user. It includes IDLE (the default Python editor), the PIP package manager, and additional documentation. The installer also creates necessary shortcuts and file associations.

Customizing the installation allows changing these installation options and parameters.

4. Choose the optional installation features. Python works without these features, but adding them improves the program's usability.

![alt Python Setup - Optional Features](image-43.png)

Click Next to proceed to the Advanced Options screen.

5. The second part of customizing the installation includes advanced options.

Choose whether to install Python for all users. The option changes the install location to C:\Program Files\Python[version]. If selecting the location manually, a common choice is C:\Python[version] because it avoids spaces in the path, and all users can access it. Due to administrative rights, both paths may cause issues during package installation.

Other advanced options include creating shortcuts, file associations, and adding Python to PATH.

![Python Setup - Advanced Options](image-44.png)

After picking the appropriate options, click Install to start the installation.

6. Select whether to disable the path length limit. Choosing this option will allow Python to bypass the 260-character MAX_PATH limit. 

![Python Setup - Completed](image-45.png)

The option will not affect any other system settings, and disabling it resolves potential name-length issues. We recommend selecting the option and closing the setup.

# STEP 4: Add Python to Path (Optional)

If the Python installer does not include the Add Python to PATH checkbox or you have not selected that option, continue in this step. Otherwise, skip to the next step.

Adding the Python path to the PATH variable alleviates the need to use the full path to access the Python program in the command line. It instructs Windows to review all the folders added to the PATH environment variable and to look for the python.exe program in those folders.

To add Python to PATH, do the following:

1. In the Start menu, search for Environment Variables and press Enter.

![System Environment Variables](image-46.png)

2. Click Environment Variables to open the overview screen.
System properties environment variables button.

![Environment Variables](image-47.png)

3. Double-click Path on the list to edit it.

![Environment Variables - Path](image-48.png)

Alternatively, select the variable and click the Edit button.

4. Double-click the first empty field and paste the Python installation folder path.

![Python Installation Folder Path](image-49.png)

Alternatively, click the New button instead and paste the path.

5. Click OK to save the changes. If the command prompt is open, restart it for the following step.

# STEP 5: Verify Python Was Installed on Windows

The first way to verify that Python was installed successfully is through the command line. Open the command prompt and run the following command:

      $ python --version

![Python Version](image-50.png)

The output shows the installed Python version.

The second way is to use the GUI to verify the Python installation. Follow the steps below to run the Python interpreter or IDLE:

1. Navigate to the directory where Python was installed on the system.

2. Double-click python.exe (the Python interpreter) or IDLE.

3. The interpreter opens the command prompt and shows the following window:

![Python Shell](image-51.png)

Running IDLE opens Python's built-in IDE:

![Python IDLE](image-52.png)

In both cases, the installed Python version shows on the screen, and the editor is ready for use.

TASK 5. Install Package Managers:
   If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).

------------------- INSTALL PIP ON WINDOWS USING ENSUREPIP ----------------------

# STEP 1: Verify PIP Was Installed

To verify whether PIP was installed, enter the following command in the command prompt:

      $ pip --version

If it was installed successfully, you should see the PIP version number, the executable path, and the Python version:

![PIP Version Command](image-53.png)

PIP has not been installed yet if you get the following output:

      'pip' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
      Operable program or batch file.

If an older version of Python is installed or the PIP installation option is disabled during installation, PIP will not be available. To install PIP, see our article How to Install PIP on Windows.

# STEP 2: Install PIP using ensurepip
This uses Python to install PIP without downloading or running any scripts. Enter the following command in the command prompt:

      $ python -m ensurepip --upgrade

![Pip Installed](image-54.png)

Wait for the installation to complete. Check that PIP is installed correctly with the following command:

      $ pip --version

![pip version](image-55.png)

# STEP 3: Upgrading PIP for Python on Windows
New versions of PIP are released occasionally. These versions may improve the functionality or be obligatory for security purposes.

To upgrade PIP on Windows, enter the following in the command prompt:

      $ pip install --upgrade pip

This command uninstalls the previous version and then installs the most current version of PIP.

# STEP 4: Downgrading PIP Version

Downgrading may be necessary if a new version of PIP starts performing undesirably. To downgrade PIP to a prior version, specify the version you want.

To downgrade PIP, use the following syntax:

      $ python -m pip install pip==[version_number]

For example, to downgrade to version 18.1, run:

      $ python -m pip install pip==18.1
